# lighttable-theme-generator

Experimantal theme generation for Lighttable. This project
helps me figure out what to do next with [cljss](https://github.com/JeremS/cljss-core)
while playing with my clojure editor of choice.

Right now there is only one skin, `generator.pure` that's still buggy.
For instance, it doesn't play nice with other skins and doesn't covers everything.

But it's still fun for me... ;)
